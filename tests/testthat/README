Test is restricted to a minimum as most of the computations happen in bsafe. Reactives contain mostly
single calls to the bsafe package that has its own testing.

Implements:
- Testing of non-reactive helpers
- Testing of UI elements that appear and disappear depending on other selections
- All outputs are present
- Inputs can be read and changed
- Returned values per module are correct
- Metareactives content returned by each module returned the same object when evaluated
