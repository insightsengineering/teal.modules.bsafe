Tests are minimized as most computations occur in bsafe. Reactives predominantly consist of single calls to the bsafe
package, which has its own set of tests.

Implemented:
 - Testing of non-reactive helpers.
 - Verification of UI elements appearing/disappearing based on selections.
 - Confirmation of all outputs' presence.
 - Ability to read and modify inputs.
 - Validation of correct returned values per module.
 - Consistency ensured in metareactives content returned by each module.
